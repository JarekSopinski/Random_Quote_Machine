## Random Quote Machine

A random quote generator, fetching data from an open API. User can get a new random quote and share it on Twitter.

#### How it works

1. A random quote is fetched from an [open API](https://talaikis.com/random_quotes_api) created by Tadas Talaiks (72 000 quotes).
2. Fetching a new quote sets a new random background color. I used recursion to prevent getting the same color two times in a row.
3. Upon clicking Twitter button user can share quote's body (not url!) with author and hashtags already included.
